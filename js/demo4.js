Also also also, the way these girls who have \"maintained\" their hair for so long eventually choose to go natural. I know the process is SUPER hard, but you'll thank yourself in due time, your baby girl or little girls that know you will thank you in many ways, your precious hair will thank you etc. I know after meeting you all, I don't fear the future times, Gods willing, that I have to comb my child's hair. You know the deal. Anyway, I'm really also glad for you all to be accepting me despite my skin color, the years of proving to people that I am not who I look like. Its like, HARD, telling people that more than half of my family is black and brown- I just came out really white 🙃. The only thing we are overcoming now is realizing I can't really, you know, tan.

He still chose to dive in despite the bees that had a hive and puffed smoked around her. Despite the many flaws that hung from the cracks of her lips and gave the color to her red eyes. He closed his lids and fell between her lips, the taste of soft Carmel candy, sugar daddy, teeth not neatly stacked like the way she smiled when she said \"hello\".

The scent of himself reminded her of wolves, would she satisfy his idea of charming love, silhouette love, lusting love because He thought that if He loved her enough, would the sparks within her flame again. Would he cause the blazing brown in her eyes turn dark red. Would he stir his coffee again with cinnamon, she is here no longer shall he need sugar to awaken him.
